## Contextual Information
### Repository description
Here you will find code chunks used to analyse neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) for 
example their morphology, and resulting data.

### PURPOSE
This repository has been generated to share code, code snippets and data used in NMJ-
analysis (e.g. the comparative anatomy of the neuromuscular junction between 
mammalian species).

### ETHICS
All tissue from human studies were covered by the requisite ethics approvals (NHS 
Lothian REC: 2002/1/22, 2002/R/OST/02; NHS Lothian BioResource: SR719, 15/ES/0094).

## Repository file overview
dendogram_distance_matrix.R ....... script to generate a Tanglegram  
PCA_muscavr.csv ................... average data from NMJ-morph/aNMJ-morph for each muscle from all species analysed

### KEYWORDS
neuromuscular junction, NMJ-morph, aNMJ-morph, morphology, extensor digitorum longus, 
peroneus longus, soleus

### DATA REUSE
This repository is of interest for (a) beginners wanting to familiarise themselves 
with NMJ-analysis. e.g. NMJ-morph (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.008) 
or aNMJ-morph (https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200128) as the raw data provides the 
opportunity for comparison; (b) researchers in the field of comparative anatomy 
wanting to compare their species' NMJ-morphology to other species average NMJ
morphology;

## General Information
### Biological Context
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a synapse formed between lower motor neuron 
and target skeletal muscle fibre. Due to its crucial role in the facilitation of 
movement, it is involved in neurodegenerative conditions and both basic neuroscience 
and clinical neuroscience research focus a lot of their efforts on its study. Whilst 
the NMJ is affected in many neurodegenerative conditions in humans, the vast majority 
of anatomical and physiological data concerning the NMJ come from lower mammalian (e.g. 
rodent) animal models. Recent findings demonstrated major differences between the 
anatomy of human and rodent NMJs, and a follow up study demonstrated that human NMJs 
are more similar in their morphology to NMJs of larger mammals (sheep, pig). Animal 
models that are similar to the human cellular and molecular anatomy, will more likely 
best represent the human NMJ in health and disease, thus study of comparative NMJ 
morphology plays an important part in basic neuroscience research.

mammalian neuromuscular junction" (https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13260).
